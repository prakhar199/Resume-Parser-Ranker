The purpose of Basel II, which was initially published in June 2004, is to create an international standard that banking regulators can use when creating regulations about how much capital banks need to put aside to guard against the types of financial and operational risks banks face. In practice, Basel II attempts to accomplish this by setting up rigorous risk and capital management requirements designed to ensure that a bank holds capital reserves appropriate to the risk the bank exposes itself to through its lending and investment practices.  The New Accord includes several methodologies for determining a bank's risk-based capital requirements for credit, market and operational risk. For Risk Based Capital (RBC), Credit Usage (CU) and Stress Test (ST), the methodologies that will be used for repo style transactions are Simple VaR if the collateral is eligible. If the collateral is ineligible then the Wholesale loan approach will be utilized or the collateral will be reduced to zero in the Simple VaR. .

The purpose of Basel II, which was initially published in June 2004, is to\ncreate an international standard that banking regulators can use when creating regulations about\nhow much capital banks need to put aside to guard against the types of financial and operational\nrisks banks face. In practice, Basel II attempts to accomplish this by setting up rigorous risk\nand capital management requirements designed to ensure that a bank holds capital reserves\nappropriate to the risk the bank exposes itself to through its lending and investment practices.\n\nThe New Accord includes several methodologies for determining a bank's risk-based capital\nrequirements for credit, market and operational risk. For Risk Based Capital (RBC), Credit Usage\n(CU) and Stress Test (ST), the methodologies that will be used for repo style transactions are\nSimple VaR if the collateral is eligible. If the collateral is ineligible then the Wholesale loan\napproach will be utilized or the collateral will be reduced to zero in the Simple VaR.\n.\nRoles and Responsibilities: Development, Testing and support.\nSoftware Used: Oracle 9i\n\nOTHER PROJECTS AND REAL TIME TRAINING:\n\nRTRM(Railway Ticketing System Through Mobile)\nA mobile based real time application with many exciting features like checking pnr status, train\navailability, trains between stations etc. This application was done in j2me and it uses weblogic\nas server and MSSQL as the database.\n\nUndergone a mandatory Training on Finance By Oracle Corporation\n\nEDUCATION\n\nBirla Institute Of Technology -  Pilani, Rajasthan\n\n2011\n\nBachelor of Technology in Computer Science\n\nUniversity College Of Engineering, University Of Kerala\n\n2005 to 2009\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\nSKILL SET:\n\n\n\nLanguages: Core Java\nFront end/GUI Tools programming: Adobe Flex, GWT\nDatabase: Oracle 10g\nIDE: Eclipse, FlexBuilder\nFrameWorks: Spring(Basics), MVC frame work\nOperating System: Windows, Linux, Unix", {'entities': [(4652, 4849, 'Skills'), (4607, 4611, 'Graduation Year'), (4543, 4575, 'College Name'), (4499, 4540, 'Degree'), (4493, 4497, 'Graduation Year'), (4441, 4470, 'College Name'), (4410, 4427, 'Companies worked at'), (2654, 2671, 'Companies worked at'), (2632, 2651, 'Designation'), (1323, 1327, 'Graduation Year'), (1260, 1277, 'Companies worked at'), (1238, 1257, 'Designation'), (603, 615, 'Companies worked at'), (487, 504, 'Companies worked at'), (465, 484, 'Designation'), (53, 66, 'Location'), (39, 51, 'Companies worked at'), (16, 35, 'Designation'), (0, 14, 'Name')]}), ('Imgeeyaul Ansari\njava developer\n\nPune, Maharashtra - Email me on Indeed: indeed.com/r/Imgeeyaul-Ansari/a7be1cc43a434ac4\n\nWilling to relocate to: Pune, Maharashtra\n\nWORK EXPERIENCE\n\nApplication Developer\n\nOracle Financial Software Services -  Pune, Maharashtra -\n\nAugust 2016 to Present\n\n• Wrote Services in java using data annotation which in turn were used for creating other files\nusing code generation tool.\n\n• Jar of services with related utility files such as DTOs are deployed on the Host side.\n\n• Host side is hosted on Tomcat Server where proxy files are present.\n\n• Created jsff page for UI, and wrote action, helper, assembler, backing bean for UI side business\nLogic made entries in collectionAppModule, PageDef.\n\n• Used ADF & MVC architecture for building application.\n\nUsed JUnit for Testing services,Algorithms.\nAlso made test Suites For running multiple test case at one go.\n\nUsed Eclipse Debugger for Fixing Service Related Jiras.\nMade Use of Hot Deployment for Fixing Ui related Bugs on UI side which was run on Weblogic\nServer. \nUsed JAWS Reader for solving accessibility Related jiras and IA plugin.\n\nUsed Java to write Batches for fetching of Bulk Data at Regular Interval.\nIt created Thread for Multitasking to reduce the time for processing.\n\nEDUCATION\n\nBachelor of Enginerring in Information Technology\n\nArmy institute of technology -  Pune, Maharashtra\n\n2012 to 2016\n\nCBSE in Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics\n\nRashtriya Military School Bangalore -  Bengaluru, Karnataka\n\nhttps://www.indeed.com/r/Imgeeyaul-Ansari/a7be1cc43a434ac4?isid=rex-download&ikw=download-top&co=IN\n\n\n2010 to 2011\n\nCBSE in Mathematics and English\n\nRashtriya Military School Bangalore -  Bengaluru, Karnataka\n\n2008 to 2009\n\nSKILLS\n\nJAVA (1 year), CSS (1 year), HTML (1 year), MYSQL (1 year), JAVASCRIPT (Less than 1 year),\nAngularjs (1 year), Oracle Pl/Sql\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\nTECHNICAL SKILLS\nProgramming Languages :C/C++, angular, java, java servlet, HTML, java script, MySQL, css, jsff.\n\nOperating Systems Linux, Windows, Android\n\nORM Eclipse Link, Hibernate\n\nFramework & tools :ADF, Eclipse, Android Studio, Git, Selenium, Code blocks, Net beans, R studio,\nTortoise SVN.', {'entities': [(1894, 2172, 'Skills'), (1726, 1850, 'Skills'), (1711, 1715, 'Graduation Year'), (1643, 1677, 'College Name'), (1610, 1641, 'Degree'), (1433, 1467, 'College Name'), (1385, 1389, 'Graduation Year'), (1359, 1362, 'Location'), (1327, 1355, 'College Name'), (1276, 1324, 'Degree'), (269, 273, 'Graduation Year'), (242, 245, 'Location'), (204, 237, 'Companies worked at'), (181, 201, 'Designation'), (145, 148, 'Location'), (33, 36, 'Location'), (17, 30, 'Designation'), (0, 15, 'Name')]}), ('Jay Madhavi\nNavi Mumbai, Maharashtra - Email me on Indeed: indeed.com/r/Jay-\nMadhavi/1e7d0305af766bf6\n\nI look forward to being associated with a growth - oriented, learning firm and\ncontribute my skills for its success.

They also use a different work order\nreport in Maximo V4 and V6. The earlier used report have many drawbacks such as\n\nNo Flexibility for modification since it is used by many divisions\nEmpty boxes, lot of missing information\nNot align with Systems objectives and processes\nHistorical context on the asset is missing\nEsthetical issues: Font too small, input fields not instinctive\nNo bar coding used\n• The outcome of this report is a form to support technician's work and regulation and give\nthem simplicity to input information. It covers the full spectra of requirements of System Services\ndivisions.\n• This report is site specific one and it will display the WO details along with its task WOs and\nfailure reporting information.\n• Each site is having their own logo. This current report will display the logo based on site.\n• It was implemented in V7.1 only. In V7.1 we do not have the option of auto resetting page\nnumbers (i.e., while displaying multiple WOs, for each new WO page number will not be reset\nautomatically) . I have implemented this option in this report.\n• Language Translation was used for this report in German and French\n• I did not use IBM templates for this report. I have customized our own template in this report.\n\nBTRAMR0009.rptdesign (Availability Report):\n\n• This particular report relates to the requirement of the business to be able to create a\nAvailability Graph based on selected Train Assets, a timeframe and selected work types / work\norder parameters.\n• Availability can be calculated based on a Fleet or a single Train. The business requirement is to\nbe able to select this base as needed to suit the project or view needed at that time.\n\nBTRAMR0027.rptdesign (Card Stock Report):\nExisting report functionality:\n• Technician requiring a part will take the component in its bin along with an Inventory Card. The\ntechnician reports the consumption at the exit of the storeroom on the Kiosk computer where\nhe scans its Work Order and the Inventory Card in the application Issue and Transfer of Maximo.\nWhen we rebuild something internally, the technician will bring the new assembly in store, grab\nthe Inventory Card and he will report the return in store against the rebuilt Work order.\nObjectives:\n• Created a card stock report in order to match the existing Inventory Card tool developed by\nSystems.\n• Increase reporting of consumption\n\n\n\n• Redefine the process of cycle count (80% efficiency in Systems)\n• The report will be based on inventory information and will introduce the notion of real time to\nincrease precision\n\nBTRAMR0001SBB.rptdesign (Report Change):\n• The report BTRAMR0001SBB was developed for the European project. It is based on the\nBTRAMR0001MLM report and currently uses only launch option 2 and 3 of the BTRAMR0001MLM\nreport. The client requested to have option 1 (type=1) of the BTRAMR0001MLM implemented in\nthe BTRAMR0001SBB report as well as the translation of the labels from French to English.\nObjectives:\n• To have define the type=1, report definition for BTRAMR0001SBB\n• To have the labels translated from French to English\n\nBTRAMR0002.rptdesign (Systems Purchase Requisition Report):\n\n• The current PR report does not have bar-coding feature and is formatted too small. This is an\noperational report; it will be used in real time.\n• Have a common and standardized PR report across all Systems services sites with the support\nof bar-coding\n\nIncident Management Solution report:\n• The report displays the overall ticket progress. It shows count of tickets raised and assigned to\nboth Infosys and Client queue. We can view the total no. of tickets raised for various application\ngroups such as Maximo, Kronos and BIEM. It also further categories the ticket count based on\nticket priority and the status.

They also use a different work order\nreport in Maximo V4 and V6. The earlier used report have many drawbacks such as\n\nNo Flexibility for modification since it is used by many divisions\nEmpty boxes, lot of missing information\nNot align with Systems objectives and processes\nHistorical context on the asset is missing\nEsthetical issues: Font too small, input fields not instinctive\nNo bar coding used\n• The outcome of this report is a form to support technician's work and regulation and give\nthem simplicity to input information. It covers the full spectra of requirements of System Services\ndivisions.\n• This report is site specific one and it will display the WO details along with its task WOs and\nfailure reporting information.\n• Each site is having their own logo. This current report will display the logo based on site.\n• It was implemented in V7.1 only. In V7.1 we do not have the option of auto resetting page\nnumbers (i.e., while displaying multiple WOs, for each new WO page number will not be reset\nautomatically) . I have implemented this option in this report.\n• Language Translation was used for this report in German and French\n• I did not use IBM templates for this report. I have customized our own template in this report.\n\nBTRAMR0009.rptdesign (Availability Report):\n\n• This particular report relates to the requirement of the business to be able to create a\nAvailability Graph based on selected Train Assets, a timeframe and selected work types / work\norder parameters.\n• Availability can be calculated based on a Fleet or a single Train. The business requirement is to\nbe able to select this base as needed to suit the project or view needed at that time.\n\nBTRAMR0027.rptdesign (Card Stock Report):\nExisting report functionality:\n• Technician requiring a part will take the component in its bin along with an Inventory Card. The\ntechnician reports the consumption at the exit of the storeroom on the Kiosk computer where\n\n\n\nhe scans its Work Order and the Inventory Card in the application Issue and Transfer of Maximo.\nWhen we rebuild something internally, the technician will bring the new assembly in store, grab\nthe Inventory Card and he will report the return in store against the rebuilt Work order.\nObjectives:\n• Created a card stock report in order to match the existing Inventory Card tool developed by\nSystems.\n• Increase reporting of consumption\n• Redefine the process of cycle count (80% efficiency in Systems)\n• The report will be based on inventory information and will introduce the notion of real time to\nincrease precision\n\nBTRAMR0001SBB.rptdesign (Report Change):\n• The report BTRAMR0001SBB was developed for the European project. It is based on the\nBTRAMR0001MLM report and currently uses only launch option 2 and 3 of the BTRAMR0001MLM\nreport. The client requested to have option 1 (type=1) of the BTRAMR0001MLM implemented in\nthe BTRAMR0001SBB report as well as the translation of the labels from French to English.\nObjectives:\n• To have define the type=1, report definition for BTRAMR0001SBB\n• To have the labels translated from French to English\n\nBTRAMR0002.rptdesign (Systems Purchase Requisition Report):\n\n• The current PR report does not have bar-coding feature and is formatted too small.

It shows count of tickets raised and assigned to\nboth Infosys and Client queue. We can view the total no. of tickets raised for various application\ngroups such as Maximo, Kronos and BIEM. It also further categories the ticket count based on\nticket priority and the status.

INI Parsing tool is a tool\nwhich accepts MML Commands in certain grammar and generates Resource file and Binary File\nrespectively which will be read by server to resister the commands.\nInvolved in the development, testing, verification of the module on windows.\n\n\n\nModule - Man Machine Language\nMML is a configuration tool widely used in communication equipments. It uses Client/Server\narchitecture. MML server communicates with both the client and the APP in the equipment.\nIt receives MML commands inputted by users from the client and relays it to APP to process\nit. After acquiring the processing result, the server generates a MML report and sends it back\nto the client. It interacts with other system modules. Connection Management, Authorization\nManagement, Command Process, Data Synchronization, Event Notification, Command Parsing,\nLOG/ALARM Handling are some of the functions of MML Server.\nInvolved in the development, defect fixing and verification of the module on windows, Linux and\nvxworks platforms Involved in several release activities.\n\nModule - Configuration Management\nConfiguration Management Module is core module of System Management. Its main function\nis to define specifications for configuration management interface between the configuration\ntool layer and the application layer, and provide related configuration command communication\nmechanism. Any information that can be modified by the user/application and that affects the\nfunctionality of the application can be regarded as configurable data. All configuration commands\ncan be sent to Configuration Management Module using a common interface type.\nConfiguration Data Management Module is a supplementary optional component that can be\nloaded to provide a persistent storage (&amp; retrieval) mechanism for applications\' static\nconfiguration data.\nInvolved in the defect fixing and feature enhancement of the module on windows, Linux and\nvxworks platforms Involved in several release activities.\n\nModule - TL1\nTransaction Language 1 (TL1) is a widely used, "legacy", management protocol in\ntelecommunications. It is a cross-vendor, cross-technology man-machine language, and is\nwidely used to manage Synchronous Optical Networks (SONET) . It is defined for operation\nsystem/ network element (machine-to-machine) interfaces. TL1 corresponds to the User System\nLanguage (USL), which is the language for human-to machine interactions. It is used for managing\nnetwork elements in a network. TL1 Module is an interface between an Application and Client.\nClient sends the TL1 Commands to perform some configuration operations in the Applications.\nTL1 module process the client text TL1 commands according to standard specification TL1 GR\n831 and interacts with the Configuration management module and Convert Response messages\nback to TL1 Response messages\nInvolved in development, verification and customer and release activities.
